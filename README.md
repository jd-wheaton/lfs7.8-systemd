lfs7.8-systemd
==============
- Mastering Linux with an LFS Project
- Using LFS-BOOK-7.8-systemd.pdf as 'the' guide
- Located at http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable-systemd/LFS-BOOK-7.8-systemd.pdf
- SysV vs. Systemd : As my day to day machine uses Systemd, I decided to go this route
- I'm aware the pros and cons of this decision, but there is no reason the next project
- can't be done using SysV
